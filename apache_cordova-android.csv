"Don't filter gradle's stderr anymore","### Motivation and Context<!-- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? --><!-- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->When building the project by running `gradlew`, we filter its output on `stderr` to omit a specific diagnostic message. This complicated refactorings in the past and also affects upcoming refactorings regarding `Q` and `superspawn`.The [reason this code exists](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-9971) is a weak one IMHO. The Visual Studio integration deemed the build to have failed if anything has been output on `stderr`. Thus the aforementioned diagnostic message on `stderr` caused successful builds to count as failed ones.IMHO, the current behavior should be removed for various reasons:- Diagnostics on `stderr` are not uncommon, so the success of the command should be determined from the returned `Promise` or the process' exit code respectively- Unclear if code works correctly & reliably: the code is written as if only complete lines were passed into `progress`. But [`superspawn` calls `notify` for every `chunk` it receives in a `data` event on `stderr`](https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/blob/8bd95b4c11b3c0d9b42e6607d51778077da58746/src/superspawn.js#L111-L115). AFAIK it is not guaranteed that these chunks will be individual and complete lines.- Unclear if code is up-to-date- Code is untested- Complicates refactorings### Description<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->This PR removes all output filtering in `ProjectBuilder.prototype.build`.### Testing<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->Automated tests still pass.","open","860","null","","undefined"

What problem does it solve? --><!-- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->There was a condition in `validateProjectName` that prevented the project name from started with a number. It was found that this was added approximately 5 years ago, and it was assumed that once upon a time, this was because project names were used to generate a java class, based on the comments. However, that no longer appears to be the case.Being able to support project names that starts with a number is important and perfectly valid (e.g: [8 Ball Pool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.eightballpool)).It fixes #584 and fixes #701  where lots of people requested this change.### Description<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->Simply removed the condition preventing project names from starting with a number. `validateProjectName` has two other checks which were left untouched. I've also updated the comments to remove any references suggesting that successful `validateProjectName` calls means its safe to use the string as a java class name.There was a unit test test for failure for project names starting with numbers which have been removed.

"Borderless/notch devices doesn't display a fully fullscreen mode","# Bug ReportHello, I'm not sure where I should open this issue. I have already tried [here](https://github.com/mesmotronic/cordova-plugin-fullscreen/issues/38) but the issue has been closed quickly because:> it appears to be a wider Cordova issue rather than a plugin issue.## ProblemThe webview isn't taking the whole space on new Android wide and borderless devices (such as Samsung Galaxy s10, Google Pixel 3XL or OnePlus 6T). As you can see on the attached file, the app is disturbed/displaced from the left side (or top side in portait) which is displaying a black area.![android-bordeless-fullscreen-ultrawide](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21133515/65510499-5fe8bf80-ded5-11e9-9230-3c8b3059f577.png)Of course I use the `<preference name="Fullscreen" value="true" />` in my **config.xml**.### What is expected to happen?The app webview should be displayed correctly, 100% fullscreen, without that black area. My app works and displays well on all 'normal' Android devices.## InformationI found some help on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54369068/2908227) about how to let the webview taking 100% of the screen.First you have to create a new **styles.xml** at the www/ root folder. The **styles.xml** files contains:```xml<resources>    <style name="Full">        <item name="android:windowLayoutInDisplayCutoutMode">shortEdges</item>    </style></resources>```Then in the  **config.xml** files you have to custom/edit with:```xml<platform name="android">    <resource-file src="www/styles.xml" target="app/src/main/res/values-v28/styles.xml" />    <edit-config file="AndroidManifest.xml" mode="merge" target="/manifest/application">        <application android:resizeableActivity="false"/>    </edit-config>    <edit-config file="AndroidManifest.xml" mode="merge" target="/manifest/application/activity">        <activity android:theme="@style/Full"/>    </edit-config>    <config-file parent="./application" target="AndroidManifest.xml">        <meta-data android:name="android.max_aspect" android:value="5.0" />    </config-file></platform>```Ok well, this fix the problem. But! This causes new issues such as (see attached file below):1 - the Status Bar can't be hidden anymore during app launch. I tried all methods with [StatusBar.hide()](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-statusbar/#statusbarhide) and the [immersiveMode() fullscreen plugin](https://github.com/mesmotronic/cordova-plugin-fullscreen) but nothing helps.2 - Also, the Splaschreen can't appears fully fullscreen. There is still an empty area on left side even if the app will fit all the screen area after the Splaschreen sequence. I tried to create a splash image larger than the device, it doesn't works. Plus, you get the UI (buttons bar) displaying on the right side for a few seconds at the app launch.![android-theme-full](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21133515/65511395-6a0bbd80-ded7-11e9-935a-67b4ce0adb80.png)Did you guys encountered same issues with those borderless devices?What method we should use to let the webview taking 100% of the screen?Any suggestions would be really welcome.
